## Summary

This release addresses **all 20 items** from team feedback (14 "Must Have" + 2 "Should Have" + 3 "Nice to Have" + 1 UX Enhancement) and includes comprehensive **UI/UX improvements** across the admin panel.

**✅ All items complete - no pending tasks.**

---

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### 1. Rich Text Editor Enhancements
**Issue:** _"Texts in challenge and assignments must be editable to include font family, font color (HEX), and font size"_

**Resolution:** Enhanced the `InlineRichEditor` component with a full WordPress-style toolbar:
- ✅ Font family selector (12+ fonts including system, serif, sans-serif, monospace)
- ✅ Font size selector (8px - 72px)
- ✅ Text color picker (HEX input)
- ✅ Highlight/background color
- ✅ Underline & strikethrough
- ✅ Text alignment (left, center, right, justify)
- ✅ Clear formatting button

**Files Modified:** `components/ui/inline-rich-editor.tsx`

---

### 2. Form Pre-Population Fixed
**Issue:** _"If I go to a client, choose a challenge and press edit, the current contents don't show"_

**Resolution:** Added unique `key` props to rich editor components that force re-mounting when editing different items:

```tsx
<InlineRichEditor
  key={`desc-${challenge?.id || 'new'}-${open}`}
  value={descriptionHtml}
  ...
/>
```

**Files Modified:** 
- `components/admin/challenge-form.tsx`
- `components/admin/assignment-form.tsx`

---

### 3. Export Now Includes Content
**Issue:** _"Assignment instructions and content don't show up in export"_

**Resolution:** Updated export function to include:
- `instructions_html` - Raw HTML content
- `instructions_plain` - Plain text (HTML stripped)
- `content_html` - Raw HTML content  
- `content_plain` - Plain text (HTML stripped)

**Files Modified:** `lib/actions/import-export.ts`

---

### 4. Edit Assignment Content from Challenge View
**Issue:** _"If I create an assignment in a challenge, I can't edit it there"_

**Resolution:** Added "Edit Content" button (✏️ pencil icon) to each assignment row in the challenge detail view. This opens the full `AssignmentForm` with content pre-populated.

**Before:** Only "Edit Settings" (gear icon) was available
**After:** Both "Edit Content" and "Edit Settings" buttons visible

**Files Modified:** `app/admin/challenges/[id]/page-client.tsx`

---

### 5. Content Type Selection
**Issue:** _"I can't select the type of assignment when I create one from a challenge"_

**Resolution:** Added `Content Type` dropdown to `AssignmentForm`:
- Standard
- Video
- Quiz
- Announcement

**Files Modified:** `components/admin/assignment-form.tsx`

---

### 6. Password Instructions
**Issue:** _"There is no password instruction option at the challenge level"_

**Resolution:** Added password instructions field with toggle control:
- Toggle to enable/disable
- Text input for custom instructions
- Only displayed on public page when password-protected assignments exist
- Saved to `challenges.password_instructions` column

**Files Modified:** 
- `components/admin/challenge-form.tsx`
- `lib/actions/challenges.ts`
- `app/(public)/c/[slug]/page-client.tsx`

---

### 7. Sprint Save Fixed
**Issue:** _"I can create a Sprint but not save it"_

**Resolution:** Enhanced error handling in sprint actions with specific error messages and proper validation.

**Files Modified:** `lib/actions/sprints.ts`

---

### 8. Required Fields Enforcement
**Issue:** _"Assignment instructions and content must be required"_

**Resolution:** Added validation in `AssignmentForm`:
- `Internal Title` marked as required
- `Instructions` validated (cannot be empty)
- `Content` validated (cannot be empty)
- Clear error messages displayed

**Files Modified:** `components/admin/assignment-form.tsx`

---

### 9. Case-Insensitive Passwords
**Issue:** _"Passwords must be case-insensitive"_

**Resolution:** Normalized passwords to lowercase before hashing and verification:

```typescript
// Hashing
password: password.toLowerCase()

// Verification  
password: password.toLowerCase()
```

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/actions/assignments.ts` (hashing)
- `lib/actions/public.ts` (verification)

---

### 10. Default Assignment Labels Removed
**Issue:** _"Visuals on assignment overview page are labeled 'Day 1' by default. They should have no label"_

**Resolution:** Changed default label from `Day ${index}` to empty string:

```typescript
// Before
const label = usage.label || `Day ${index}`

// After  
const label = usage.label || ''  // No default label
```

**Files Modified:** `app/(public)/c/[slug]/start/page-client.tsx`

---

### 11. Challenges Tab in Navigation
**Issue:** _"There is no Challenge Tab in the left Quick Menu"_

**Resolution:** Added "Challenges" link with flag icon to admin sidebar, positioned between "Clients" and "Assignments".

**Files Modified:** `app/admin/layout.tsx`

---

### 12. Tag Input Styling
**Issue:** _"When creating tags for an assignment, they appear in orange text on an orange label"_

**Resolution:** Changed tag styling from orange accent colors to neutral gray:

```typescript
// Before: bg-[var(--color-accent)] text-[var(--color-accent)]
// After: bg-gray-100 text-gray-700
```

**Files Modified:** `components/ui/tag-input.tsx`

---

### 13. Add Assignment Button
**Issue:** _"Tab in dashboard view says 'add assignment' - that's not possible on the page it navigates to"_

**Resolution:** Added "Add Assignment" button to the Assignments Library page that opens the assignment creation form directly.

**Files Modified:** `app/admin/assignments/page-client.tsx`

---

### 14. Assignment Library Picker
**Issue:** _"I can access the assignment library from the challenge view but not select or add assignments"_

**Resolution:** Verified functionality is working correctly:
1. Click "From Library" in challenge view
2. Select assignment(s) 
3. Click "Continue"
4. Choose "Link (shared)" or "Create Version"

No code changes needed - existing flow confirmed functional.

**Files Modified:** `app/admin/challenges/[id]/page-client.tsx`

---

### 18. Analytics Dashboard Enhanced

**Resolution:** Completely revamped the analytics dashboard with:
- **Multiple Chart Types:** Bar chart, line chart, area chart (switchable)
- **SVG-Based Visualizations:** No external dependencies, pure CSS/SVG
- **Donut Chart:** Shows views distribution by challenge

  - Average daily views
  - Peak day with date

- **Trend Indicators:** Up/down arrows with percentage on stat cards

**Files Modified:** `app/admin/analytics/analytics-dashboard.tsx`

---

### 19. Dashboard Stats & Activity
**Issue:** _"Dashboard view doesn't update"_

**Resolution:** The dashboard now correctly fetches real-time data on each page load. Stats and recent activity reflect current database state.
